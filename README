Bots 2.0 development branch
This branch is being used for the development of new and improved bots for tremulous.

The goals of this rewrite are:
Reduce the complexity of the bot's AI functions
Improve code readability
Fix longstanding bugs
Improve the design and extensibility of the code
Be a much better "base" for even more advanced bots in the future

Currently, the bot is finished, but needs testing and bugs ironed out
