del -- deletes the waypoint you are close to
connect -- use once to select a waypoint, use again on another waypoint to connect the two
disconnect -- use once to select a waypoint, use again on another waypoint to disconnect the two
timeout -- change the timeout value of a waypoint, default: 10000. Timeout is the maximum amount of time a bot will try to get to a waypoint before rerouting (used in case bot goes off path)
radius -- change the radius of a waypoint. The radius is how close the bot has to get to the waypoint before starting to head to the next one
class -- change the classes that can use a waypoint. Default: all 
action -- add an action to a waypoint, the bot will then perform that action when he gets there
autoconnect -- attempt to automatically connect waypoints EXPERIMENTAL
migrate -- migrate over PBot path files or older CoWBot waypoints so they can be used by CoWBot
save -- save the waypoints for the map
cancel -- cancel the last action

When !waypoint is used without any arguments, it displays the current attributes of the waypoint you are closest to.

Maximum number of waypoints: 500

!drawnodes
