Bots 2.0 development branch
This branch is being used for the development of new and improved bots for tremulous.

The goals of this rewrite are:
Reduce the complexity of the bot's AI functions
Improve code readability
Fix longstanding bugs
Improve the design and extensibility of the code
Be a much better "base" for even more advanced bots in the future

Currently, most of the bot's functions have been reimplemented in the new design sceme, but 
some things (roaming) are missing and the code does not compile yet.
